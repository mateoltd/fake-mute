# Discord client-side hook: Fake mute & defean 

This script allows the user to fool the server into beliving the user is muted/deafened but still let through audio from the mic input and output to headphones.
This means that you can listen conversations while deafened and talk while muted.

## How to use it
I do not endorse the usage of this kind of client-side exploitation, the code is just uploaded as an archive and for research purposes.
